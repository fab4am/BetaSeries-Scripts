Ok I do a README file ...

To Install this soft just do :
 * make venv (everything should compile without errors (screw warnings ...))
 * source venv/bin/activate
 * make app

Then you can access everything on http://127.0.0.1:5000

/!\ Configure options before :
 * basepath is where all your series are
 * download.folder.torrent is where your torrent files goes
 
Step once configured :
 * Sync file system
 * deactivate series you don't want to work on (download, watch, sync with betaseries ...)
 * then sync all to betaseries or each serie/season one by one
 


DISCLAIMER
----------

I'm highly testing a lot of stuffs, and growing this software randomly, if you experience something bad ... cry !
